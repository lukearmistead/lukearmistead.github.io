Hi, I'm Luke. As a self reflection junkie and chronic overoptimizer, I've used dozens of different tools to feed my addiction to the appearance of self improvement. Most recently, I ditched fancy apps and went back to the basics - good old fashioned pen and paper. I kept a bullet journal for the entirety of 2018, iterating on the layout each week. The coolest part of my system was quantifying habits. Each day I'd write down, say, the number of hours I'd slept that night. At the end of the month, I'd pull the weekly averages into a handdrawn line graph kind of like this.

```
TODO LINE GRAPH PHOTO
```

So cool. So artistic. So nerdy. So incredibly heavyweight. By the time I'd finished remembering each day's habits, moods, sleep hours, and happenings I'd be too bored to actually synthesize the information into actionable insights. To make matters worse, I have a _terrible_ memory. Terrible. What did I work on yesterday? Work stuff, duh. When is my uncle's birthday? Some time in spring I think. How many hours did I sleep Tuesday? Six I guess. Bad data is worse than no data because it means bad decisions made with high confidence. And for this chronic overoptimizer, that simply will not do.

It turns out that we create a lot of data just by living in the 21st Century. Banks log our transactions, our calendars log our gatherings, and our heart rate trackers log our activity. What if we pulled all that stuff together and treated self reflection like an analysis of all that data? I like data, so this probably sounds more exciting to me than most. This is my blog though. We're rolling with it.

Here's my general plan, written with all the delusional ambition of three-coffee Luke.

1. Connect to one data source. We'll start with Fitbit.
1. Using that data, run an analysis to establish one metric worth monitoring and improving.
1. Connect to a second data source. Financial data seems like a good candidate.
1. Make a pretty data visualization I can use to show people I totally have my life under control

The long run goal here is to create a system of automated pipelines that accumulate all my data in a warehouse that supports a suite of key metrics I seek to monitor and improve over time. Even three coffee Luke thinks that's a pretty ambitious goal. We'll see how far we get.

My next post will cover connecting to my Fitbit data using their developer API. After that, we'll get to the good stuff - turning that data into insights.


#### TODO
- Add bullet journal photos
- Add headers and bolding to break up text blocks
