    "Our quest to to overengineer the quantified self continues! Last time, we grabbed a plethora of [health data using Fitbit](http://luuuuke.com/jekyll/update/2019/10/20/connect_to_fitbit_data.html). Today, we're talking money! How much am I spending? How much am I making? How much do I have? We can answer all of these questions and more using the really cool, really robust API provided by [Plaid](http://plaid.com/). This post walks through setting up an account and connection with Plaid to access and store your data. Once stored, there's all sorts of cool analyses we could run to increase financial awareness and improve spending habits. Enough talk. Let's get to it!\n",

    "Start by getting your creds from [Plaid's website](https://dashboard.plaid.com/signup). Signing up gets you 1 free connected account but you can [request developer access](https://dashboard.plaid.com/overview/development) to get another 99 if you're like me and want to connect more.\n",

    "Next, export the creds listed on your newly created account into your local environment. [Plaid's quickstart tool](https://github.com/plaid/quickstart/blob/master/python/server.py) specificaly expects the variable names printed below, so be sure to export them that way!\n",
